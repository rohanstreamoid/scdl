# Soundcloud Music Downloader
## Description

I am experimenting with this for python practice.

This script is able to download music from http://www.soundcloud.com and set id3tag to the downloaded music.
It should work with OS X, Linux, Windows.


## System requirements

* Python3


## Instructions
### Installation
___
1. Install scdl `pip3 install scdl`
2. (Optional) Setup your path and your auth_token in `$HOME/.config/scdl/scdl.cfg`


### Authentication:
___
> Get your auth token here: [Token](http://flyingrub.tk/soundcloud/)

* This allows scdl to access to your user profile data.
* You need to have this set to be able to use the `me` option
* Soon scdl will be able to download a user's stream


## Help
### Usage:
```
  scdl -l <track_url> [-a | -f | -t | -p][-c][-o <offset>][--hidewarnings][--debug | --error][--path <path>][--addtofile][--onlymp3][--hide-progress]
